== AI Agent Verification Suite

AI agents probably can't land on the moon yet – so let's start with a simulation. The beginnings of AI meeting the beginnings of moon landings: in 1969, a high school student wrote the first Lunar Lander in FOCAL. In 2025, we use it to test AI agents on two challenges:

1. *Transpilation*: Can the agent understand and port historical FOCAL code to modern Go?
2. *Soft Landing*: Which agent achieves the softest landing playing the original simulation?

Tested agents:

* Antigravity
* ChatGPT o3
* Claude Code
* Claude Sonnet 4 (via IntelliJ IDEA)
* Windsurf GPT-4.1

See `cmd/` for implementations and `PROMPT.md` for evaluation criteria.

== About the Game

Tiny terminal based lunar lander game, ported from the 70s.

A spaceship simulation: your job is to land the Apollo lunar capsule on the
moon. This is a port of the original lunar lander written in FOCAL, written by Jim Storer when he was in high school in 1969 in FOCAL for a DEC pdp8.
Famous source code in BASIC: http://www.vintage-basic.net/bcg/lunar.bas.

It is ported as close as possible to the original source, so don't take this as
idiomatic Rust code :-)

There's also a Go version on bitbucket.

== DEC FOCAL

The original source code is available as a DEC FOCAL for PDP-8

5. Running FOCAL today
Route	How to set it up on a modern Linux box	Good for
SIMH + paper-tape FOCAL	dnf install simh → simh pdp8 → load focal.bin	100 % original interpreter, runs any historical tape image.
RetroFOCAL (open-source C port)	git clone https://github.com/maurymarkowitz/RetroFOCAL && make	Quick native binary; feels like FOCAL-69, no emulator needed.
GitHub
focal-69 on GitHub	git clone https://github.com/AndrewSav/focal-69 && make	Another clean-room implementation; useful on macOS or BSD too.
GitHub
Because the language fits in <10 KB, all of these interpreters launch instantly and happily run on Raspberry Pi or within a Docker container.

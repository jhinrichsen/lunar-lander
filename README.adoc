Tiny terminal based lunar lander game, ported from the 70s.

A spaceship simulation: your job is to land the Apollo lunar capsule on the
moon. This is a port of the original lunar lander written in FOCAL. Original
source code: http://www.vintage-basic.net/bcg/lunar.bas.

It is ported as close as possible to the original source, so don't take this as
idiomatic Rust code :-)

There's also a Go version on bitbucket.
